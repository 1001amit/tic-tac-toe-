HOW TO USE:
Run the script 

Players alternately enter their moves by providing row and column numbers.
      for example:-Player X, enter your move (row[1-3] column[1-3]): 1 3
      Here the player x provided the input 1(row) 3(column)
The game updates the board after each move and checks for a winner or a tie condition.
When a player achieves three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, the game declares them the winner.
If no moves are left and no winner is determined, the game declares a tie.
